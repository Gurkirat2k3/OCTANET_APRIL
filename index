                        <p>A gym is a building, club, or large room that usually has special equipment for physical exercise and fitness. The word gym comes from the ancient Greek word gymnasion, which means "school for naked exercise". Gymnasiums were important to the ancient Greeks, and every important city had at least one. They were usually built by the state and grew from gathering places to imposing structures with dressing rooms, baths, training quarters, and special areas for contests.</p>
